# msauth

Forked from [Earlybyte/aad_oauth](https://github.com/Earlybyte/aad_oauth)
Learning how to create "A Flutter OAuth package for performing user authentication against Azure Active Directory OAuth2 v2.0 endpoint."

Supported Flows:

- [Authorization code flow (including refresh token flow)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)

## Usage

For using this library you have to create an azure app at the [Azure App registration portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/). Use native app as platform type (with callback URL: <https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf).>

## Not release

This is only the place holder not release yet.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
